# DASS (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale) Analysis

Welcome to the **DASS Analysis** project! 🧠💡

This Python-powered tool lets you dive into the world of mental health analysis! It compares **Depression**, **Anxiety**, and **Stress** scores before and after an intervention. With some cool statistical tests (paired t-tests, ANOVA) and eye-catching visualizations, you’ll see the impact of interventions like never before. Ready? Let’s make mental health analysis fun! 🎉

## Installation

🎉 **Let’s get started!** 🎉

Follow these simple steps to get everything up and running in no time!

1. Clone this repo (or just grab it from GitHub):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dass-analysis.git
   cd dass-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (for keeping things neat and tidy):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. **No more missing packages, just smooth sailing!** ⛵

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

And boom! You’re good to go! 🚀

## Usage

Time to rock and roll with the analysis! 🕺💃

1. **Place your DASS dataset** (pre/post-intervention scores) in a CSV file.
2. **Run the magic** with the `dass_analysis.py` script. Sit back and let the analysis do its thing! ✨

For example, in your terminal, type:

```bash
python dass_analysis.py path_to_your_data.csv
```

And voilà! You’ll get:

* Paired t-test results to compare pre- and post-intervention scores.
* ANOVA results to spot group differences.
* Beautiful visualizations (because stats should be pretty too, right?).

## Features

Here's where it gets really cool! 😎✨

* **Paired t-tests**: See if the intervention really made a difference in Depression, Anxiety, or Stress. 🔍
* **ANOVA**: Compare scores across groups and discover any big differences. 👀
* **Visualizations**: Box plots, histograms, and all the pretty graphs you could dream of. 📊
* **Data Preprocessing**: Don’t worry about cleaning your data—we’ve got it covered! 🧹

## Dataset Structure

Now, let’s talk about the dataset—it's like the secret sauce to making everything work. 🥒🍔

### The Essentials:

* Each row is **one participant** (because we love individuals!).
* You'll have columns for pre- and post-intervention scores for **Depression**, **Anxiety**, and **Stress**.
* **Participant\_ID** is key! It keeps track of all your mental health rockstars. 🎸

### Quick Notes:

* **Participant\_ID**: A unique identifier for each participant (no duplicates, please!).
* **Pre\_XXX** and **Post\_XXX**: The scores for Depression, Anxiety, or Stress (you’ll see them as `Pre_Depression`, `Post_Anxiety`, etc.).
* The data should be **clean and numeric** (no funky symbols or missing scores).

It’s simple, but it’s powerful! 💪

## Tests

We’re all about precision. 🎯 The project comes with a set of tests to make sure everything runs perfectly and your analysis is spot-on. ✅

### What gets tested?

* **Paired t-tests**: Check if your statistical tests are firing on all cylinders.
* **ANOVA**: Make sure we’re comparing groups like pros.
* **Data preprocessing**: Confirm that your data is prepped and ready for action.

### Running Tests

Running tests is easy! All you have to do is this:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

And voilà! You’ll see the results in no time. 🏁

## Dependencies

Here’s what you need to make all this magic happen:

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* pytest (because we need to test, test, test!)

To install them all at once, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
